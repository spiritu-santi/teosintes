Data and Scripts (written by Jonás A Aguirre Liguori)

All scripts were written in R and have only been tested with the original dataset of teosintes. 
We do not guarantee that the script would work without major edits. 
We will keep posting updated (more cleaned) versions of the script as we implement it on other datasets in hope of making it run more automatically.
